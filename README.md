# Algorithm Visualizer

Welcome to Algorithm Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by pathfinding algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. You can access it here (use Google Chrome!):

## Meet the Algorithms

This application supports the following algorithms: 

**Dijkstra's Algorithm**: the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

**A* Search**: arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Greedy Best-first Search**: a faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A*; does not guarantee the shortest path

**Swarm Algorithm**: a mixture of Dijkstra's Algorithm and A*; does not guarantee the shortest-path

**Convergent Swarm Algorithm**: the faster, more heuristic-heavy version of Swarm; does not guarantee the shortest path

**Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm**: Swarm from both sides; does not guarantee the shortest path

**Breath-first Search**: a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path

**Depth-first Search**: a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path

On top of the pathfinding algorithms listed above, I implemented a **Recursive Division** Maze Generation algorithm.
